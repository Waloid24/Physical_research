# About this repository
Here I collect my experimental works on physics, which were highly appreciated in the framework of the **"Question of Choice"** competition by the Department of General Physics at MIPT.

At the moment, I have **two** such works, each of which you can familiarize yourself with by going to the appropriate folders.
Perhaps in the future I will publish my *laboratory work in physics*, which I did as part of the training sessions.
