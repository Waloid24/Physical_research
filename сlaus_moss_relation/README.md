# Clausius–Mossotti relation
## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank **Stanislav Vladilenovich Vinogradov** for his help in formulating the idea of the study and clarifying some theoretical issues.
I am grateful to [Pavel Konstantinovich Kuzmichev](https://www.ibch.ru/structure/groups/nmr/742) for providing a place in the laboratory where it was possible to safely work with toxic substances. Without this, the experimental part of the work would not have been possible.
## About my work
In this paper, I experimentally tested the limits of applicability of the standard form of the Clausius-Mossotti equation for two pairs of liquids: benzene with hexane and oxane with toluene. Studies have shown that the results differ from those expected from theory by 50-60%, which is a satisfactory result if the order of magnitude is estimated. For more accurate results, it is worth using formulas that are specialized for experimental conditions and sample type.
## Some details of the process
- I worked with my brother, and I must admit that teamwork speeds up the process :)
- If you are interested in the calculations, then I advise you to watch the presentation: `Cl-Mas.pdf`

## Conclusion
Although physical experiments are difficult, they are very interesting. I recommend it to everyone!
